        <div>It looks like Ambrosia is having some maintenance issues at the moment. Sorry about that! The project was made in an emulation of an original Game Boy Advance, 
        so it doesn't always play nice with modern web architecture. I'm doing everything I can to get it running in browser. If you would like, you can still play it the traditional way, 
        but it is a little more complicated.</div>
        <div>First, click <a href="Project.gba">here</a> to download the ROM.</div>
        <div>After that, go to <a href="https://gba.ninja/">gba.ninja</a> and run the file. Pay attention to your keybindings, as all tutorials will be given for GameBoy buttons, not a keyboard.</div>
        <div>Oh! GBA Ninja also doesn't like homemade ROMs, and will give you an error message. Just click "Run it anyway", it will work.</div>
