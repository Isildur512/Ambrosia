        <p>It looks like Ambrosia is having some maintenance issues at the moment. Sorry about that! The project was made in an emulation of an original Game Boy Advance, so it doesn't always play nice with modern web architecture. I'm doing everything I can to get it back up soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out Roller Rush, or one of my other projects. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
